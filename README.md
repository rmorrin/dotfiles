#Dotfiles
These are a copy of my dotfiles, configurations and utilities I use frequently. I've tried to keep things roughly separated by category/application.

I work frequently on both Windows/OSX and aim to have as much cross-compatibility as possible, but obviously some OS-specific config is unavoidable.

## Dependencies
If running Windows, Git's included Unix tools must be available in your PATH. I also use [Cmder](https://github.com/bliker/cmder) as my console emulator,
which has a build available that includes these by default.

## TODO
* Install script (Windows and OSX)
* Better update strategy (to pull changes into repository)
